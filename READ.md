# Vagrant VM Setup and Bash Script Automation

This project involves setting up a virtual machine (VM) using Vagrant and configuring a Bash script to perform the following tasks:

1. **Create a Directory with Two Files:**
   - The script will create a directory.
   - Inside this directory, it will generate two files: `file1` and `file2`.

2. **Monitor and Report CPU Usage:**
   - The script will set up a cron job to monitor CPU usage.
   - It will send an email with the CPU usage report every minute to `akinzvillconcept@gmail.com`.
